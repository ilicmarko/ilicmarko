## Hi there 👋

Full stack web developer from Serbia. I am super passionate about web technologies, optimization and workflow innovations. I have been making an influence on the web since 2011. I am driven to improve my workflow and as such I am constantly integrating new technologies for task automation and project optimization. My greatest interest has been in the area of website optimization.

## Stack
Trying to stay agnostic, love vanilla JS. If I have to use a framework, Vue or Svelte will be my choice.
